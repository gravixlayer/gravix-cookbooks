    "# Gravix Layer Cookbook: Proactive AI Learning Coach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an example cookbook demonstrating the Gravix Layer Memory feature through a Proactive AI Learning Coach use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn**:\n",
    "- How to setup the Gravix Layer client and memory service\n",
    "- How to add manual memories and use infer=True to extract memories from conversations\n",
    "- How to build a scheduled/proactive agent that searches memory, reasons, and acts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent's Goal:** To help a user learn a new skill by remembering their long-term goals, tracking their progress, and proactively suggesting next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Goal Setting - The user defines their main goal. We manually add this as a core memory.\n",
    "2. Progress Tracking - The user has a conversation about what they've completed. We use `infer=True` to automatically log this progress.\n",
    "3. Proactive Agent Logic - We simulate the agent \"waking up,\" reviewing its memory of the user, and generating a personalized, proactive message to help the user take the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Make sure `GRAVIXLAYER_API_KEY` is set in your environment before running the notebook.\n",
    "- This is intended as a cookbook recipe for Gravix Layer users."

    "This notebook presented a cookbook example for building a Proactive AI Learning Coach using Gravix Layer's Memory and Chat APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory can store explicit user goals and extract facts from conversations (use `infer=True` to automatically extract and store facts).\n",
    "- The agent pattern (Search → Think → Act) is effective for scheduled, proactive messaging.\n",
    "- Persisting agent actions back into memory lets the system avoid repeating suggestions and improves personalization over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add monitoring and logging for production readiness.\n",
    "- Extend to multi-user scenarios and persistent storage for long-term analysis.\n",
    "- Add tests for memory indexing and retrieval latency.\n"
